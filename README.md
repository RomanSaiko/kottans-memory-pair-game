# Memory – Pair Game

In this section you will create _Memory - Pair Game_ — a card game in which
all of the cards are laid face down on a surface and two cards are flipped
face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs
of matching cards. The game ends when the last pair has been picked up.
